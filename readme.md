To-do list coding challenge with React


<h3>Project Details</h3>
<p>This is a to-do list built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and React. It is designed to allow users to add items to a to-do list and then check them off as they are completed. A running counter keeps track of how many active items (meaning items not yet completed) are on the list. Once a user either checks an item as "DONE" or deletes it from the list, the item is removed from the counter.</p>

<h3>Built With</h3>
<p>Cloud 9 - Web-based integrated development environment</p>
<p>Bootstrap - For styling and visual effects</p>
<p>FontAwesome - For check-mark and "X" icons</p>
<p>React - To build the user interface</p>
